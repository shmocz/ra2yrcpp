# pyra2yr

Python interface for ra2yrcpp. Includes a websocket proxy and client capable of communicating with ra2yrcpp using the main protobuf specification. This package is directly bundled to ra2yrcpp with the intention to use exact same protobuf definitions generated during ra2yrcpp build.

## Setup

In a suitable Python environment, invoke:

```bash
$ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt .
```

## Usage

See `pyra2yr/test_*.py` files for example usage.
